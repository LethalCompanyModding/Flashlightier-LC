# Flashlightier-LC

Allows modifying various values of the flashlight/pro flashlight.

Primarily for people with sensitive eyes or streamers that need to change how the light appears due to modifying the gamma setting.

## How to use this mod

Simply edit the values in the config file before launching the game

## Values

- Light Color (create softer or harsher lights)
- Light Intensity (accessability for people with sensitive eyes)
- Light Size (used to create more interesting looking lights)

This does NOT allow you to modify battery life or light range as those are balancing options.
